# GENERIC - TRAIT - LIFETIME 

## Generic 
We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types.

- Generic fucntion: Allow function to take generic parameters 
- Generic struct: Allow creating struct with a generic type 
- Generic enum: Same as struct. Example: Option<T>
- Generic method: Generic behavior for struct's method implementation
